# Car Price Prediction

This repository contains a project for predicting car prices using machine learning. The objective is to develop a regression model that predicts the price of a car based on several features such as the car's brand, model year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and condition.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to provide an accurate estimation of car prices based on historical car listings. By applying machine learning models to a dataset with over 180,000 car listings, we create a regression model to predict prices for future listings.

### Dataset
- **Features**:
  - `id`: Unique car identifier
  - `model_year`: Year of the car model
  - `mileage`: Mileage of the car in kilometers
  - `brand`: The car brand (e.g., Toyota, Ford)
  - `fuel_type`: Type of fuel (e.g., Petrol, Diesel)
  - `transmission`: Transmission type (e.g., Manual, Automatic)
  - `ext_col`: Exterior color
  - `int_col`: Interior color
  - `accident`: Binary flag indicating accident history
  - `clean_title`: Binary flag for clean title (no significant damage history)
  - Other relevant features related to car condition and market data
- **Target**: 
  - `price`: The car's price in the market.

### Preprocessing

We performed the following steps during preprocessing:
- **Numerical Features**: Passed through without transformation (`id`, `model_year`, `mileage`).
- **Categorical Features**: OneHotEncoded to convert categorical variables like `brand`, `fuel_type`, `transmission`, etc., into numeric form.
- **Binary Features**: Encoded using OneHotEncoder (e.g., `accident`, `clean_title`).

### Model

- **Linear Regression**: A simple yet effective regression model was used to predict car prices.
- **Pipeline**: We utilized a pipeline to preprocess the data and train the model in a single workflow.

### Evaluation

- The model's performance was evaluated using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**. The RMSE gives insight into how close the predicted prices are to the actual prices.

### Result

The final model was trained on 80% of the dataset and evaluated on 20% validation data. The model achieved an RMSE of [insert RMSE score here] on the validation set.

## Running the Project

### Requirements

Make sure to install the necessary dependencies before running the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Steps to Run:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashique-exe/Car-Price-Prediction---Linear-Regression.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Prepare the dataset. The dataset should be placed in the `data` folder, or you can modify the path in the code as necessary.

3. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. To generate predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input new_data.csv --output predictions.csv
   ```
